# System Design Documentation for NewsWave Using the RADIO Framework

## Overview

This system design document outlines the design aspects of NewsWave, a news feed application that fetches and displays articles from various RSS feeds. The document uses the RADIO framework, which stands for Requirements Exploration, Architecture/High-Level Design, Data Model, Interface Definition, and Optimizations and Deep Dive.

## Requirements Exploration

### Problem Understanding

The key problem is to fetch news from specified RSS feed URLs, parse them, and display the fetched articles in an HTML format. The entire process should be automated and deployed via GitHub Actions.

### Scope

1. Fetching the RSS feeds from a given URL
2. Parsing the RSS feeds to extract news items
3. Generating HTML output from parsed data
4. Automating the process using GitHub Actions
5. Deploying the output HTML to GitHub Pages

### Questions for Clarification

1. What are the expected volume and frequency of updates to the RSS feeds?
2. Is there a requirement for handling multiple RSS feed sources?
3. What is the expected latency between a news item being published on the RSS feed and it appearing on the website?
4. Is user interaction, such as feed customization, within the scope of this project?

## Architecture/High-level Design

### Key Components

1. **RSS Fetcher**: Uses Axios to make HTTP requests to fetch RSS feeds.
2. **RSS Parser**: Utilizes the RSS-Parser library to parse RSS feeds.
3. **HTML Generator**: Generates HTML using parsed RSS data.
4. **GitHub Actions**: Orchestrates the automated fetching, parsing, and deployment.

### Component Relationship

- **RSS Fetcher** fetches data and passes it to **RSS Parser**.
- **RSS Parser** processes the data and passes it to **HTML Generator**.
- **HTML Generator** creates an HTML file and commits it to the repo.
- **GitHub Actions** automates these tasks and deploys the HTML to GitHub Pages.

## Data Model

### Entities

1. **RSS Feed**
    - URL
    - Title
    - Description

2. **News Item**
    - Title
    - Link
    - Publication Date

### Component Ownership

- **RSS Fetcher** owns **RSS Feed** data.
- **RSS Parser** and **HTML Generator** own **News Item** data.

---

## Interface Definition (API)

1. **RSS Fetcher**
    - `fetchRSSFeed(url: string): Promise<RSSFeed>`
  
2. **RSS Parser**
    - `parseRSSFeed(feed: RSSFeed): Promise<NewsItem[]>`

3. **HTML Generator**
    - `generateHTML(items: NewsItem[]): string`

Each component communicates through these defined interfaces, passing data from one component to the next in the data flow.

## Optimizations and Deep Dive

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Caching**: Store fetched news items temporarily to reduce the number of requests to RSS servers.
2. **Batch Processing**: Fetch and parse multiple RSS feeds concurrently for efficiency.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement a rate limiter to avoid hitting API limits for frequently updated feeds.

### Areas of Interest

1. **Extensibility**: How can we design the system to easily add more RSS feed sources?
2. **Reliability**: What mechanisms can we put in place to ensure the system handles failures gracefully?
3. **Security**: How can we ensure that the fetched content is secure and free from malicious links or code?
