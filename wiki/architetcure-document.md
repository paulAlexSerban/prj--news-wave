## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive architectural overview of the NewsWave application. This includes detailing the system components, data flow, and dependencies involved in fetching, parsing, and displaying RSS feeds.

### 1.2 Scope

The scope of this document is confined to the NewsWave application architecture, with specific focus on:

- How RSS feeds are fetched and parsed
- How the news feed is displayed in HTML
- Automation and deployment via GitHub Actions

---

## 2. System Components

### 2.1 Node.js

The application runs on a Node.js environment for executing JavaScript server-side.

### 2.2 Axios

Axios is used for making HTTP requests to fetch RSS feeds.

### 2.3 RSS-Parser

RSS-Parser is used to parse the RSS feeds and extract news items.

### 2.4 GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions are used to automate the fetching, parsing, and deployment process.

---

## 3. Data Flow

1. **Fetch RSS Feed**: Axios makes a request to the specified RSS feed URL.
2. **Parse RSS Feed**: RSS-Parser parses the fetched RSS data.
3. **Generate HTML**: The parsed data is used to generate an HTML file that displays the news feed.
4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: The generated HTML is deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

---

## 4. Libraries and Dependencies

- Node.js
- Axios: `npm install axios`
- RSS-Parser: `npm install rss-parser`

---

## 5. Automation and Deployment

### 5.1 GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Checkout Code**: Checkout the latest code from the repository.
2. **Setup Node.js**: Setup the Node.js environment.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install the required libraries and dependencies.
4. **Run Script**: Execute `index.js` to fetch, parse, and generate the HTML file.
5. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: Deploy the generated HTML to GitHub Pages.

### 5.2 Configuration File (main.yml)

Located in `.github/workflows/`, this YAML file specifies the GitHub Actions workflow.

---

## 6. Future Improvements

1. **Multi-source support**: Ability to fetch from multiple RSS sources.
2. **User Interface**: Develop a UI to allow users to select their preferred news sources.
3. **Caching**: Implement caching to store fetched news items temporarily to reduce server load.
